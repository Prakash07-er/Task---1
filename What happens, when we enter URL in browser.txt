This is what happening when we enter the URL in the browser

1. You enter a URL into a web browser
2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
3. The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
4. The server sends back a HTTP response
5. The browser begins rendering the HTML
6. The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
7. Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.
