HTTP version History:

   1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web.
   2. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991.
   3. HTTP uses port number 80 for TCP
   4. HTTPS uses port number 443 
   
HTTP/0.9:

Year of release 1991

It is extremely simple requests consist of a single line and start with the only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource.
There were no status or error messages.

HTTP/1.0:

Year of release is 1996

Version information is now sent within each request.

A status code is also sent at the beginning of the response.

The HTTP headers has been introduced.

The transfer of other documents than plain HTML files has been added.

HTTP/1.1 :

Year of release is 1997

A connection can be reused.

Pipelining has been added, allowing to send a second request before the answer for the first one is fully transmitted.


Cache control mechanism have been introduced.

HTTP/2:

Year of release is 2015

It is a binary protocol rather than text.

It is a multiplexed protocol. Parallel requests can be handled over the same connection, removing the order and blocking issues of the HTTTP/1.1 protocol.

It compresses headers. As these are often similar among a set of requests, this removes duplication and overhead of data transmitted.


HTTP/3 - HTTP over QUIC:

The next major version of HTTP, HTTP/3, will use QUIC instead TCP/TLS for the transport layer portion.
