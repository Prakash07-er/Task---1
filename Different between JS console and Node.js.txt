First of all, Both the browser and Node use JavaScript as their programming language.


Node.js

1. Node.js is has a single thread for running javascript and it uses the event queue. 
2. Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application.
3. Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node you will run the application on
4. This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 JavaScript that your Node version supports.
5. Node uses the CommonJS module system
6. Nodejs doesn’t have predefined global objects “window and location” which has functions and attributes..

JS Browser console:

1. In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node, of course. You don’t have the document, window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.
2. And in the browser, we don’t have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.
3. Here we you don’t get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use.
4. JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow and users a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web, you are stuck to use older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.
5. In the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.
6. In browser “window and location” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes.
